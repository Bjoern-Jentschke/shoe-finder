# ShoeFinder App

The ShoeFinder App is a simple  application developed as a part of my learning journey with technologies such as Node.js, MongoDB, React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project serves as a practical implementation to reinforce my understanding of these technologies, focusing on key concepts like CRUD operations with MongoDB and effective state management in a React application.

The goal of this app lies in assisting users to discover their ideal running shoe. Through a exploration, users can filter through different categories to find a shoe that perfectly aligns with their unique needs.

Also users can highlight favorites and look at them. They will also be able to add their thoughts as comments to their used shoes as well as rate their experience.

This application is in building process.
